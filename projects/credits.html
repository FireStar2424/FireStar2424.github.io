The music is maade by several people, which are: <a target="_blank" href="https://calumbowen.bandcamp.com/">Calum Bowen</a> (For Lovely Planet music), <a target="_blank" href="https://re-logic.com/">Re-Logic</a> 
 <br>
  (For Terraria music), <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bensound.com/">Bensound</a> (Although their music is royalty-free), and <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/The-Nick-of-Time/">The-Nick-of-Time</a>.<br>
  This was a really old project, and back in the day I just put in a bunch of music I liked just for the heck of it (I never really meant to share it).<br>
