  A list of projects I made. Divided into 2 types. (I would call these more "tests that are slightly better than the actual '<a href="https://firestar2424.github.io/tests">Tests</a>' section", so these are basically crap.)
    <br>
    <h2><strong>Packaged Types</strong></h2>
    <h4>A list of Scratch projects packaged into HTML via the <a target="_blank" href="https://packager.turbowarp.org/">Turbowarp Packager</a>. (Also, some of these have things taken from multiple sources, so heres the <a href="https://firestar2424.github.io/projects/credits">credits</a>)</h4>
    <p><a href="https://firestar2424.github.io/projects/packaged_loading-bar"><strong>Packaged: Loading Bar</strong></a> This is more of a test to see if Github could take a full-on Scratch project. Just enter in a number, I guess (I basically took a random project I made, so this is actually a really weird one)</p>
    <br>
    <h2><strong>HTML Types</strong></h2>
    <h4>These are projects made in real HTML. I'm not really good at it yet, so these are more deserving of the <a href="https://firestar2424.github.io/tests">tests</a> section.</h4>
    <p><a href="https://frestar2424.github.io/projects/stopwatch"><strong>Stopwatch</strong></a> This is a literal timer, I guess. This is more of a test than anything</p>
