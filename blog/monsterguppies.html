    <p>Long story short: they get out of control.
<br>
<br>
So, guppies typically give birth to fry every month. Ok, sounds pretty normal. So what?
<br>
Well...
<br>
IT TAKES A MONTH FOR A PREGNANT GUPPY TO GIVE BIRTH.
<br>
Thats right. A month.
<br>
Which means they make get pregnant again AS SOON as they give birth. I mean, thats great for breeding, but for people who just want fish, this is kinda a disaster. Sure, you can seperate them, but get this:<br>
<strong>FEMALES CAN MAKE BABIES BY THEMSELVES.</strong> Ok, not entirely true, but they can keep male sperm in them for up to six months, which they can make babies with. Guppies also are able to breed around 6 weeks, and you can tell the difference between male and female guppies at about 4 weeks. Which means, if you aren't fast, by the time you sort your babies, they could've already bred!<br>
On the other hand, this is a <em>great</em> fish to breed. Depending on the breed, they can sell for up to 100$ per pair! They can breed up to 20 times in their life, and make about 1-200 babies per batch.<br>
<br>
So, in a nutshell: guppies are great for breeders, not so good for just fishkeeping (unless you're ready to get a bunch of tanks for the sheer amount of babies you're going to have).</p>
