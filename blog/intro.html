    <p>Ok, so you click that tiny button on the footer of my main page that says "blog" and now you're here. So, what does this blog post anyways? Well, nothing much.
    <br>
    I guess I'll write an occasional post or article or whatever about things I like (mostly about anime or fish). I guess I might also update on my fish. idk
    <br>
    I'm really bad at writing long things so most of them will be pretty short. I would just end it here, but it seems a bit too short, so i'll write some more
    <br>
    I really don't have a lot of time to be doing this a lot (i'm a busy person!), but I hope you like it. I'm not really good at coding, so this'll be pretty low tech.
    <br>
    I know there is a lot of website and blog makers out there, but this is more of a personal project, to try and improve my coding skills. I might make an actual blog
    <br>
    later, but for now, this is all I can do.
    <br>
    I might do reviews on things, as well, so stay tuned!
    <br>
    I have something to do, so I'm going to go now.</p>
