    <p>Hello humans! My name is FireStar2424.
    <br>
    I really like coding, reading books, and watching anime.
    <br>
    I can't say I'm that impressive, but if you want to see any projects I made, go <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/FireStar2424/projects/">here</a>!</p>
    <br>
    Hmmm... other than that I have:
    <div class="container">
    <ul class="things-ul">
      <li>1 month coding experience (In HTML/CSS)</li>
      <li>2 year Scratch experience</li>
      <li>crap art</li>
      <li>2 other seperate websites for myself</li>
      <li>nothing really impressive</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Contacts. Riiight. I forgot about that. Ummmmm for that I just guess you would go <a href="https://firestar2424.carrd.co">here</a>?</p>
